# Supabase Realtime Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to standardize the Map Painter IO application on Supabase Realtime for all real-time communication needs.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Custom WebSocket Implementation**

   - Deleted `src/server/index.ts` and `src/server/GameManager.ts` (WebSocket server)
   - Deleted `src/lib/contexts/WebSocketContext.tsx` (WebSocket context)
   - Deleted `src/lib/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` (WebSocket hook)

2. **Enhanced Supabase Realtime Implementation**

   - Updated `src/lib/hooks/useSupabaseRealtime.ts` with:
     - Improved error handling
     - Reconnection with exponential backoff
     - Message queuing when disconnected
     - Better type safety
     - Comprehensive status reporting

3. **Updated Game Realtime Context**

   - Modified `src/lib/contexts/GameRealtimeContext.tsx` to:
     - Use only Supabase Realtime
     - Implement optimistic updates
     - Handle presence for online players
     - Provide consistent error handling

4. **Updated Game Realtime Hook**

   - Enhanced `src/lib/hooks/useGameRealtime.ts` to:
     - Use the improved Supabase Realtime hook
     - Provide game-specific real-time functionality
     - Handle state updates and player presence

5. **Updated Game Types**

   - Modified `src/types/game.ts` to:
     - Align with Supabase Realtime message format
     - Simplify data structures
     - Improve type safety

6. **Added Documentation**
   - Created `docs/SupabaseRealtimeArchitecture.md` with a mermaid diagram
   - Created this implementation summary

## Benefits of Standardization

1. **Simplified Architecture**

   - Single communication system instead of two parallel systems
   - Clearer data flow and responsibility boundaries
   - Easier to understand and maintain

2. **Improved Reliability**

   - Robust reconnection handling
   - Message queuing during disconnections
   - Consistent error handling

3. **Better Developer Experience**

   - Unified API for real-time communication
   - Type-safe interfaces
   - Clear documentation with architecture diagrams

4. **Reduced Server Complexity**
   - Leveraging Supabase's managed infrastructure
   - No need to maintain custom WebSocket server
   - Simplified deployment

## Implementation Details

### Supabase Realtime Hook

The core of our real-time implementation is the `useSupabaseRealtime` hook, which provides:

- Channel creation and management
- Message sending and receiving
- Presence tracking
- Connection status monitoring
- Error handling
- Reconnection logic

### Game Realtime Context

The `GameRealtimeContext` builds on the Supabase Realtime hook to provide:

- Game-specific message handling
- Player management
- State ownership tracking
- Game actions (claiming, attacking)
- Optimistic updates

### Game Realtime Hook

The `useGameRealtime` hook provides a simpler interface for components that only need to:

- Subscribe to map state changes
- Track player presence
- Send state updates

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**

   - Add comprehensive tests for the Supabase Realtime implementation
   - Test reconnection scenarios
   - Test message handling

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Monitor message frequency and size
   - Implement batching for high-frequency updates
   - Optimize presence tracking

3. **Feature Expansion**
   - Add support for game chat
   - Implement spectator mode
   - Add game history tracking
